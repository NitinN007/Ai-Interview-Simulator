                        AI INTERVIEW SIMULATOR
                         SIMPLE EXPLANATION
================================================================================


WHAT IS THIS PROJECT?
================================================================================


How it works:
1. You tell the website what job you want (topic, job description, experience)
2. AI creates 5 interview questions for you
3. You record yourself answering on camera
4. AI watches your video and gives you a score (0-100)
5. AI gives feedback on how you did


WHO USES IT?
================================================================================
- Job interview candidates preparing for technical roles
- People practicing speaking skills
- Anyone wanting AI feedback on interview performance


SIMPLE FEATURES
================================================================================

1. Question Generator
   → Type: React, Python, Data Science, etc.
   → AI creates 5 custom questions for that topic

2. Video Recording
   → Click "Start Interview"
   → Answer questions on camera
   → Click "Stop" when done

3. AI Scoring
   → AI watches your video
   → Gives score: 0-100
   → Gives feedback: What you did well, what to improve

4. See Results
   → Your score displayed
   → AI feedback message
   → Video replay of your answers


TECHNOLOGY USED
================================================================================

Frontend (What user sees):
  - Next.js (React framework)
  - Tailwind CSS (nice colors & design)
  - Video recording from browser camera

Backend (What runs on server):
  - Next.js server
  - Google Gemini AI (generates questions & analyzes video)
  - PostgreSQL database (stores data)


HOW IT WORKS (SIMPLE FLOW)
================================================================================

STEP 1: Create Interview
  User enters:
    - Topic: "React"
    - Job: "Senior Frontend Developer"
    - Experience: "3 years"
  ↓
  Website sends to AI: "Create 5 React interview questions"
  ↓
  AI returns: ["Q1: What is JSX?", "Q2: Explain hooks...", ...]
  ↓
  Questions show on page

STEP 2: Record Video
  User clicks "Start Interview"
  ↓
  Camera starts (user gives permission)
  ↓
  User answers questions on camera
  ↓
  User clicks "Stop Interview"
  ↓
  Video saved

STEP 3: AI Analysis
  Website sends video to AI
  ↓
  AI watches video (analyzes speaking, clarity, answers)
  ↓
  AI returns: { score: 85, feedback: "Good clarity, work on pace" }
  ↓
  Website shows score and feedback


FILES & FOLDERS (SIMPLE)
================================================================================

app/
├── api/
│   ├── generate-questions/route.js   ← Creates questions with AI
│   └── analyze-video/route.js        ← Analyzes video with AI

│   ├── _components/

│   └── questions/page.jsx            ← Recording & results page

That's the important stuff!


KEY PROBLEMS SOLVED
================================================================================

Problem 1: AI code was breaking the website
Solution: Moved AI code to backend only (not client side)

Problem 2: AI response wasn't always JSON
Solution: Added backup way to read AI response

Problem 3: Couldn't send video over internet
Solution: Convert video to text format (base64) before sending

Problem 4: API quota limit (free tier)
Solution: Need to enable billing on Google Cloud (cheap - pennies per test)


HOW TO RUN IT
================================================================================

1. Download the code:
   git clone https://github.com/NitinN007/Ai-Interview-Simulator.git

2. Install dependencies:
   npm install

3. Get Google AI Key:
   Go to https://aistudio.google.com/app/apikeys
   Create new key
   Copy it

4. Create .env.local file with:
   GEMINI_API_KEY=paste_your_key_here
   NEXT_PUBLIC_GEMINI_API_KEY=paste_your_key_here
   NEXT_PUBLIC_DRIZZLE_DB_URL=your_database_url

5. Start website:
   npm run dev

6. Open in browser:
   http://localhost:3001


EXPLAINING TO INTERVIEWER
================================================================================

"I built an AI Interview Simulator. Here's what it does:

Users enter their interview topic and background. The app uses Google's AI
(Gemini) to generate 5 personalized interview questions. Then, users record
themselves answering those questions on camera. The AI watches the video,
analyzes their speaking clarity and confidence, gives a score from 0-100,
and provides feedback.

The backend uses Next.js server routes to safely call the AI (not from
browser). The frontend is built with React and Tailwind CSS for a clean,
responsive design.

The main challenges I solved were:
1. Moving AI calls to backend (server-only library)
2. Handling video as base64 text for HTTP transmission
3. Parsing AI responses with fallback logic

The app works end-to-end: questions → recording → analysis → results."


COSTS & REQUIREMENTS
================================================================================

Free Tier Google AI:
  ❌ Very limited quota (runs out fast)
  ✅ Good for testing with 1-2 videos

Paid Tier (Recommended):
  ✅ Unlimited quota
  💰 Very cheap (~$0.075 per 1M tokens)
  💰 1 test interview = less than 1 cent

PostgreSQL Database:
  - Free: Use Neon (serverless)
  - Link: https://neon.tech


FUTURE IDEAS
================================================================================

1. Save interview results per user
2. Track score improvements over time
3. Different interview types (behavioral, coding)
4. Real human interviewer (via video call)
5. More detailed AI feedback
6. Mobile app version


IMPORTANT FILES
================================================================================

app/api/generate-questions/route.js:
  - What it does: Creates interview questions
  - Input: topic, jobDescription, experience
  - Output: array of 5 questions

app/api/analyze-video/route.js:
  - What it does: Analyzes video and gives score
  - Input: base64 video
  - Output: { score: 0-100, feedback: "string" }

app/dashboard/_components/AddNewInterview.jsx:
  - What it does: Interview setup form
  - User enters: topic, job description, years of experience

app/dashboard/questions/page.jsx:
  - What it does: Recording page & results page
  - Shows questions, records video, displays score & feedback


TESTING IT
================================================================================

Test Case 1: Full Interview (Happy Path)
  1. Go to /dashboard
  2. Enter: Topic="React", Job="Frontend Dev", Experience="2"
  3. Click "Start Interview"
  4. Answer questions on camera (record 30 seconds)
  5. Click "Stop Interview"
  6. Should see score (80-100) + feedback + video

Test Case 2: No Answer
  1. Start recording
  2. Don't say anything
  3. Submit
  4. Should see fallback score (60) + error message

Test Case 3: Quota Exceeded
  1. If AI quota exhausted
  2. App shows error
  3. FIX: Enable billing on Google Cloud
